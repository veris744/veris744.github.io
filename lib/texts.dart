const String kAboutText = "I'm a computer science graduate with a strong passion for game programming. While completing my master’s degree in game programming, I worked as a frontend developer, and I’m currently working as a C++ developer and DevOps engineer. I’ve built this portfolio website myself, and over the years, I’ve developed games using Unreal Engine, Unity, and native C++.\nBeyond gameplay, I’m deeply interested in systems-level programming, and I’m currently developing a personal, tools-focused project—a custom game engine. I enjoy exploring emerging technologies like VR and have worked on related projects, alongside AI and UI systems for games. I really enjoy combining creativity with technical problem-solving to build experiences that are fun, responsive, and challenging.";
